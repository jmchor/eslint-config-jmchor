## my personal ESLint config file to share between projects

This is the first npm package I ever published, so it's a bit rough around the edges - bear with me!

### Installation

Just run:

```bash
npm i -D eslint-config-jmchor
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-jmchor
```

### Setup

The only thing to do is to either create or edit your .eslintrc file with

```json
{
	"extends": "jmchor"
}
```

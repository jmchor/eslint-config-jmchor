_eslint-config-jmchor - my personal ESLint config file to share between projects_

This is the first npm package I ever published, so it's a bit rough around the edges - bear with me!

**Installation**

Just run:

```bash
npm i -D eslint-config-jmchor
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-jmchor
```

**Setup**

The only thing to do is to either create or edit your .eslintrc file with

```json
{
	"extends": "jmchor"
}
```
